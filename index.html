            My one of the most favourite thing is reading and solving question in the book. I like Wimpy kid book because it has exercises to do and stories to read and also it is a comic too,and I am in 6th standard. we can also create our own comics its a story of a boy in school with his other friend.now my reading is very good and my favourite exercise is predict the future and design your own house.
